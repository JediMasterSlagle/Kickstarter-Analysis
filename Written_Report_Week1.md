# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Overview of a fundraising project to raise money for a theater, within the data collected we can analyze results of other fundraisers to be able to achieve as much from the fundraiser as possible.
### Purpose
The play analyized came close to achieving its goal,  now we can see other fundraisers that have not achieved thier goals related to launch date and total goal.  Using this dataset you are able to visualize all campaign outcomes based on launch date and goals to project possible future fundraising campaings.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
with the dataset we are able to create pivot tables and graphs through excel to easily visualize not only overall outomes of each fundraiser but see the information based on launch date and goal how close to achieving their goals each fundraiser was.  

We were also able to create a chart representing just the information for plays withing the theater group and we can see from the data that fundraisers launched later spring and summer were more often successful than others,  December being when fundraisers drop to the lowest successful rate

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Within this part of the analysis we are able to analyze information brought into a pivot table again with failed,  successful,  and canceled outcomes.

The data using outcomes based on goals rather than launch date give us a different picture and insight into dollar amounts donated toward successful fundraisers and what donation rank is the most successful.  Now we can see that the highest percentage of successful fundraisers were ones with a goal of less than $1000,  as well as an increase for campaigns with goals set between $35-$45,000 with the successful campaigns dropping drastically with goals set over $45,000.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I did encounter several challenging points during this exerciese givin that I was new to excel!  Given more time to review everything as a whole makes it less daunting and easily understandable.  
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Two conclusions are the firstly campaigns are generally more successful when launched late spring/summer,  as well as December being the month you should not consider launching a fundraiser.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
We can see that outcomes were much higher on campaigns with a goal less than $1000,  and have a much lower probability of success beyond $45,000.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
One limitation may be that while the data shows a good range of set goal amount catagories,  it is not necessarily indicitive of the exact success/fail rate as certain goal catagories have more date available to them than others.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Graphs could be easily made for different catagories beyond plays,  it could be analyized by location etc.
