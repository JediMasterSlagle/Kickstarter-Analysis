# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
    'Within this segment of the program we learned basics of excel and how to interpert and display data efficiently and easily understandable for the end user.'
### Purpose
    'The material within this coursework was designed to not only make us think through the code were adding or altering,  but how to understand at first exactly and plainly said what were intending to do with said data and to get us accustomed to repeating syntax for ease of future projects.'
## Analysis and Challenges
    'Below is representation of final outcomes for dataset visualizations performend in this exercise,  the challenge for me was overcoming being new to Excel and this helped me to quickly understand on a basic level where were starting at in coding overall and how to accomplish tasks on an atomic level of coding without auto generation and user interfaces and this was challenging for me learning the basic syntax as I am a new user to Excel as well.'
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    'With this information and the charts now generated we can easily see that the theater outcomes based on launch date not only did 2015 have the highest number of successful campaigns but also the highest number of failed,  with dramatic increase in 2013 followed by equal decrease in 2016,  with a relitively small amount of overall canceled campaigns.'
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    'Using the Outcomes based on Goals data,  we can see that the percentage of success becomes higher when goals are set above $5000 while they are more likely to fail with campaigns under a $5000 mark as well as having a much higher rate of cancellation.'
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
